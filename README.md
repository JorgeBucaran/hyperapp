# Self-Logging Hyperapp

This is a rough proposal for an integrated self-tracing/logging feature.  It's not styled right, doesn't handle async calls too well, and isn't the tidiest code, but works as a proof of concept.  


We've been developing and using this modified version of Hyperapp to teach fronted development to beginners. Using the proivided template as a starting point they test & develop their actions and logic first with the app+log from console and an empty dom.  Once all the actions work they build the ui components.  This works very well to introduce testing & development workflow, app design, code portability, and tracing without the added complexity of build scripts & dependencies.  I think an integrated log like this could be useful for more full developers as well, it's already helped a lot fixing bugs in student projects.
