# Contributor Code of Conduct

Our open source community strives to:

- **Be nice.**
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Be considerate**: Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
- **Be professional**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us at <hyperappjs@gmail.com>.
